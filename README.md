# Codidact.Authentication

The purpose of this repository is to create an authentication server that will
be used by the [codidact/core][1] repository.

All personally identifiable information (PII) will be managed by this server in
a different database that is completely seperated from everything that Core does.
This information can then be retrieved by the core application on demand.

Build instructions and such are avaliable in the [codidact/core][1] repository.
